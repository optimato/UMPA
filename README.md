# UMPA
Code for the "Unified Modulated Pattern Analysis" (UMPA) method of processing speckle-based X-ray imaging data.

The original (Python-based) implementation of the method is published in
[M.-C. Zdora, et al., “X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging and Metrology through Unified Modulated Pattern Analysis,” Phys. Rev. Lett., **118** 203903 (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.203903), and is available at https://github.com/pierrethibault/UMPA.

This repository contains an improved, faster implementation of the UMPA model, which is achieved through the use of C++ and Cython. A publication describing and explaining this implementation is in currently in review. This readme will be updated upon acceptance.

This package is also used by an extension to directional dark-field (link to repository here!). That work is described in the publication "X-ray directional dark-field imaging using Unified Modulated Pattern Analysis" by Ronan Smith et al., which is to be published in PLOS ONE shortly. (update references when ready!)
